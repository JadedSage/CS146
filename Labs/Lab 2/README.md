The approach that I took was to take the two strings and do two comparisons
first to see if they are the same length 
then sort the strings into char arrays to then sort into alphabetical order. 
Once sorted the 2nd comparison to see if the letters match
  we can do this because the letters are sorted alphabetically and since they are the same lengths and should be annagrams we can check if the characters are in the same place in both arrays
  then we have a if statement to check when the characters are not the same in which we can set our boolean to false and break out of the loop. If it still remains true we just end the loop and print the statement.
then we can print the solution
