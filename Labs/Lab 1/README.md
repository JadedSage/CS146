The high level approach used for this problem was to 
Take the target value and while going through the array
subtract the target value by the current index and save that as a temp int

Then we enter another loop that goes through the array again and tries to locate a match for the temp number 
If this temp number is a match and is also not the same index as the temp number was found in we break out of the loop
and print the Solution
