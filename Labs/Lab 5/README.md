So when look at this solution we need two thing a minimum value that we are comparing
and the head of the root to know if we are in the correct direction

We then call the method recusively
Doing this we can interate through the nodes and get to a function that compares it with minimum values
with the help of an outside global variable to keep track of the min and max values
