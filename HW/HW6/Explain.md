What I did was to first sort the input array.
This is because it allows us to test the contraints for the code
This is because if its sorted we know where to find the smallest and largest numbers
meaning we can have a comparison statements for both cases of input num being too long or short
Same but in the case of the number being to big or small

For the threesum function we have 
one for loop and one while loop

We go through the array with the for loop to insure we compared every index
The while loop is where the actual comparision comes in as because we sorted the array earlier we can see if the sum is still zero.
We repeat until end and then print the solution
