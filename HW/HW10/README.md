The method to approach this problem we need to solve the problem of
how do we know what level we are on
Because we know how to traverse the nodes but how do we keep track of what level
We do this with queues because we can add whats on the current level to the queue to then seperate in the 2d lists.
Then pop it off the queue once we are done with adding it.
Rinse and repeat until the end of the list and we finished.
