Problem 2:

MATRIX_MULTIPLY(A, B): 						1

  if columns(A) ≠ rows(B): 					1
    raise ValueError("Matrix multiplication is not defined.") 	1

  rows_A ← number of rows in A 					1
  cols_A ← number of columns in A 				1
  cols_B ← number of columns in B 				1
  result ← matrix of size rows_A x cols_B filled with zeros 	1

  for i from 1 to rows_A do: 					N+1
    for j from 1 to cols_B do: 					N(N+1)
    sum ← 0 							N*N
    for k from 1 to cols_A do: 					N(N+1)
      sum ← sum + A[i][k] * B[k][j] 				N*N
    result[i][j] ← sum return result				N

Once simplified it becomes 
7+N+1+N^2+N+N^2+N^2+N+N^2+N
Which is 

3n^2+4N+8
