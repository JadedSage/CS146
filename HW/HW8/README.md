So what I did was I used a hashmap
This is because we can have unique elements and have a counter for them 
After creating the hashmap we split the key and the list into two lists

This is because we can now divide the problem into filling the palindrome with the even elements first because that can always be a palindrome
for the odd counts we need to find the highest one to put in the center

Then we combined them all together and then grab the length of that to be returned as a int
