The way we solved the problem was to use two functions
One that checks if the current nodes are actually valid
One that does the comparison for the lowest ancestor
I solved it recursively with two if statements if the root value is greater than both the p and q and one less than both p and q
Doing this recursively we can get the root of the value that we want to be returned and use that as solution.
